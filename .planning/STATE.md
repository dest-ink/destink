## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirements — Cleanup → Provider System → Auth+UI → Deployment+Observability
- [Roadmap]: Research recommends `/gsd:research-phase` before planning Phase 3 (Auth) — pattern choice (NextAuth vs. custom JWT) not yet resolved
- [Roadmap]: Helm chart is v1 scope (DEPLOY-05, DEPLOY-06) — research flagged it as potentially v2+, but requirements keep it in Phase 4

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Auth implementation pattern unresolved — NextAuth vs. custom JWT vs. other. Run `/gsd:research-phase` before planning Phase 3.
- [Phase 2]: `platformEnum` Postgres enum expansion requires a DB schema migration for new platforms — noted but migration strategy for community providers is a v2+ concern.
